System pre-requisities for Qiskit
========================
* Ubuntu 16.04 or later
* macOS 10.12.6 or later
* Windows 7 or later

Software pre-requisites
=======================

* Python 3.5+
* Qiskit version 0.18
* Jupyter notebook
* matplotlib 3.3
* z3-solver
* tabulate

## Installation and test

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m unittest discover -v tests
```

## Run benchmarks

```
python run_benchmark.py benchmark/random.yaml
```

The result will be dump in `results/random.csv` in this case. In general, in 
`python run_benchmark.py benchmark/<something>.yaml` dumps in`results/<something>.csv`.

## Run experiments on real device

Run the corresponding jupyter notebooks: QPE_almaden/melbourne/rochester.

## Benchmark options

The way to set options for a benchmark is via a yaml file with the following format:

```yaml
# Location of the suite in which circuits() leaves.
# circuits() yield circuits to test. 
suite: benchmark.suites.random

# Optional. How many times a transpiled procees should run. 
times: 3

# Optional. Backend for PassManagerConfig. Default is FakeMelbourne
backend: qiskit.test.mock:FakeMelbourne

# A list of pass managers to run. 
pass managers:
  - qiskit.transpiler.preset_passmanagers:level_3_pass_manager
  - passmanager:level_3_with_contant_pure

# A list of fields to collect. They should be attributes of
# benchmark.utils.Result class.
fields:
  - n_qubits
  - depth
  - level3_cxs
  - we_cxs
```
